            <h3>Abstract</h3>
          <p>While there is more than one way to address the question of “Are we alone?”, the tremendously successful transit technique has demonstrated the ability to make significant strides when it comes to rocky planets orbiting nearby M-dwarf stars. Over the next decade, the James Webb Space Telescope will utilize the transit technique to determine whether rocky planets orbiting M dwarfs have tenuous, clear, or cloudy atmospheres. However, confirming the presence of biosignatures will be far more difficult. With perfect detectors and no noise floor, stacking exoplanet transmission spectra is a viable technique to improve precision and increase the detection significance of atmospheric constituents. But is it practical for real-world use in characterizing Earth-like exoplanets? Star Helix (Izenberg et al., 2020) is a proposed study project for a SmallSat that would travel away from the Earth on a trajectory that is tailored to observe multiple transits of the Earth across the Sun. There is no better way to understand how an Earth-like exoplanet appears as it transits across a Sun-like star than to actually observe the Earth as if it were an exoplanet. Star Helix is meant to be a low-cost mission that will constrain the impact of stellar and planetary variability on Earth’s measured transmission spectrum and assess the feasibility of stacking multiple transmission spectra when deriving atmospheric abundances of potentially habitable exoplanets transiting nearby M-dwarf stars.</p>

          <h3>Astrophysics Science Question</h3>
          <p>Is the transit technique an effective means to detect signs of life on Earth-like planets?</p>
          <h3>Science Goals</h3>
          <p>The science goals for the Star Helix concept are to:</p>
          <p>1. Detect signs of life in Earth’s atmosphere by using the same methodology intended for exoplanets to measure the relative abundance of habitability indicators and biosignatures (e.g. H<sub>2</sub>O, O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub>);</p>
          <p>2. Constrain the impact of stellar and planet variability on Earth’s measured transmission spectrum; and</p>
          <p>3. Assess the feasibility of stacking multiple transmission spectra when deriving atmospheric abundances of potentially habitable exoplanets transiting nearby M-dwarf stars.</p>
          <h3>Objective</h3>
          <p>The Star Helix concept will obtain multiple transmission spectra as the spacecraft’s orbit causes the Earth to pass in front of the Sun. For this mission concept, we are currently performing a trade study focusing on spacecraft configuration, orbit, and lifetime; instrument design, resolving power, and wavelength range; and science capabilities vs cost.</p>
          <h3>Approach</h3>
          <p>For its preliminary design, Star Helix will ride share to the L2 Sun-Earth Lagrange point, located 0.01 AU from the Earth. The spacecraft will then be released, deploy its solar panels, and fire its ion thrusters to travel along the Sun-Earth line (out to a maximum distance of 1.04 AU) in a helix or zigzag pattern that induces multiple transits of the Earth across the Sun, each lasting several hours. The 1U-size, mirror-less instrument will direct sunlight into two integrating spheres, through two prisms, and onto two detectors covering 0.25 – 2.5 μm, combined.</p>
          <h3>Uniqueness</h3>
          <p>We will take advantage of the telescope’s unique orbit and perspective to observe multiple Earth-Sun transits that yield transmission spectrum signal sizes that, at a distance of 0.02 AU from the Earth, are ∼2500 times larger than observing the system as a point source. By placing the spacecraft in a helix or zigzag orbit, the Earth will appear to transit the Sun numerous times within the mission’s 12-month lifetime, thus providing transit opportunities with a frequency that is consistent with planets orbiting within the habitable zone of M-dwarf stars.</p>
          <h3>Relevance</h3>
          <p>Future NASA Astrophysics missions will search for signs of life on planets transiting nearby M-dwarf stars. Doing so will require “stacking” dozens of transmission spectra to build up sufficient signal to noise while simultaneously accounting for stellar and planet variability. The Star Helix mission concept will observationally address long-standing concerns about reliably combining low signal-to-noise data from multiple transits in the face of large astrophysical systematics via a proof of concept targeting the only planet on which we know life exists — the Earth.</p>

          <h3>Possible Trajectories</h3>
          <p>Star Helix is envisioned to be a SmallSat that travels away from Earth on the Earth-Sun line, beyond the Lagrange 2 (L2) point, where the Earth would subtend a smaller solid angle from the spacecraft on the sky than the sun. The spacecraft would maneuver in such a way that it would cross the Earth-Sun line a number of times <strong>(Figure 1A)</strong>, with each crossing creating a transit of the Earth across the face of the Sun. As the spacecraft moves farther from the Earth, the Earth would appear smaller over the Sun and the transit depth would become shallower. The nominal mission would last one year, with Earth transits at least once per month. This would allow observations across a full seasonal cycle of Earth.</p>
          <p>One of the primary challenges of this mission design is that beyond L2, the spacecraft would be in a heliocentric orbit larger than Earth’s, and would need to constantly accelerate to keep up with Earth’s orbit (i.e. maintain an orbital period of one year).  While preliminary mission designs indicate that a single SmallSat with an electric propulsion system and a relatively large power system can succeed with this astrodynamical approach, an alternative configuration that is currently being investigated is multiple, much smaller CubeSats, possibly launched from a carrier/relay at L2 <strong>(Figure 1B)</strong>. These CubeSats would each be utterly minimal, containing a copy of the Star Helix spectrometer, with power, propulsion, and communication sufficient for a single transit pass. Each CubeSat would be put on a separate trajectory that allows each to cross the Earth-Sun line at a different distance from the Earth as the Earth “catches up” to the CubeSat’s larger orbit. </p>

          <h3>Boosting Earth's Spectral Feature Size</h3>
          <p>The one-scale-height molecular feature size from the Earth’s atmosphere as it transits the Sun would normally be very small (∼0.2 ppm) if viewed from a neighboring stellar system; however, the close proximity of Star Helix to the Earth presents a unique opportunity to <strong>boost the signal size by three orders of magnitude</strong>. When the star and planet are too close to be considered point sources, the standard equations for transit depth and molecular feature size (Equations 1 and 2) no longer utilize absolute radii, but angular radii instead.</p>
          <p><img src='https://kevin218.github.io/2020-07-Exo3/Eqn1+2.png' width='100%' height='auto'></p>
          <p>Thus, for the Star Helix mission concept, <var>R<sub>P</sub></var> is the angular radius of Earth, <var>R<sub>S</sub></var> is the angular radius of the Sun, and <var>H</var> is the angular scale height of the Earth. <strong>Figure 2</strong> plots the computed transit depth and feature size as a function of distance from the Earth. <strong>At a distance of 0.02 AU, the transit depth is 22% and the 1H feature size is 550 ppm!</strong></p>

          <p><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Earth-Sun transit depth (left) and one-scale-height feature size (right) versus distance from the Earth.  Star Helix will observe transit depths of 5.4 – 34% and measure spectroscopic features due to H<sub>2</sub>O, O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub> with 1H signal sizes of 140 – 850 ppm, which are significantly larger than the assumed 20 ppm instrument noise floor.</em></p>

          <h3>Simulated Results</h3>
          <p>With wavelength coverage from 0.25 – 2.5 μm, Star Helix will be sensitive to common exoplanet habitability indicators and biosignature pairs. <strong>Figure 3</strong> displays a simulated transmission spectrum of the Earth at a distance of 0.02 AU. Molecules are clearly detectable and their relative abundances will be readily constrained using publicly-available exoplanet atmosphere retrieval software.</p>
